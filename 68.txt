For the string to have 16 digits, the number 10 must be counted only once,
so it must be in the outer ring.

The highest possible "lowest" number in the outer ring is 6, if we put
6 7 8 9 10 there. Any other combination gives a smaller starting digit.

The second digit can be at most 5. There is exactly one combination that
starts with 65...

6 5 3; 10 3 1; 9 1 4; 8 4 2; 7 2 5;
